To install a custom table based sybol input method:

1. edit the file "swedishTable", in which the string that identifies each symbol is defined.  
2. run the script "install.sh", which uses the Python3 script convert.py to create a file "ibusTable".  The script also installs the file "ibusTable".  Administrator rights are requried.

To enable the input method, open language settings and add the key board "MySymbols" under Swedish.  Then use super+space to toggle to "sym".  A symbol is entered by typing its identifying string and selecting it from the table that appears.
